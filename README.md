This project involves creating the front end for a "Paradise Nursery" shopping application. The application interface enables me to browse a variety of houseplants and manage my shopping cart. Key features include:

## Landing Page
- Background image
- Paragraph about the company
- Company name
- Get Started button linking to the product page

## Product Listing Page
- Displays at least six houseplants organized into three or more categories
- Each plant includes:
  - Thumbnail image
  - Plant name
  - Price
  - Add to Cart button

## Shopping Cart Page
- Displays details of all items in the cart, including:
  - Total number of plants
  - Total cost of all items
  - Continue Shopping button
  - Checkout button
- Each item includes:
  - Thumbnail image
  - Plant name
  - Unit price
  - Total cost for each type
  - Increase/Decrease buttons to adjust quantity
  - Delete button to remove items

The header on both the product listing and shopping cart pages features a shopping cart icon with a dynamically updating number, showing the total number of items. The header also includes navigation links to other pages.

This practice project is designed to help me apply and transfer components, code, and skills for building a real-world application. The project walkthrough video demonstrates the expected functionality and design.
